# pre-requisites

- python 2.6 (2.5 probably works)
- simplejson ("easy_install simplejson" or "pip install simplejson")
- flask ("easy_install flask" or "pip install flask")

# Dashboard    

To get the dashboard going:

$ nohup ./refresh.sh &

That will regenerate dash.html every two seconds or so. If you want to slow it down or speed it up, edit refresh.sh

$ open dash.html

to open the dashboard on a mac. Use whatever command works for your system.
Cmd+Shift+F to display if fullscreen in chrome (again, whatever works for your browser)

# Claim builds
to start the claim server

$ nohup python claim_server.py &

point your browser to http://servername:8080/setup and follow the instructions.

# Example

6 builds on the dashboard. One disabled (grey), one broken (red). "translated" is currently working on the broken build.
